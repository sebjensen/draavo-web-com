							<p align="left" style="color:black"><b>Dear SCR colleagues,</b><br><br>
								It’s been 9 months since I became a Senior Guard, however, all good things must come to an end. I’ve met many fantastic people along the way, and I’ve learnt so much, but after recent events this has crossed a line it should never have reached. It’s been clear that SCR has been going downhill, and what’s worse, this has happened right before everyone’s eyes. The directors have done little about it; the community has been ignored, given no information, silenced, expected to all just calm down by locking every channel for a week. Yet, this is suppressing the issue, not fixing it.<br><br>
								Firstly, I had some issues with someone, who I will not name. I had to escalate this to a director, just for me to be told that ‘being aware of what they did’ solves the issue. So, am I able to start calling people names, and when I say ‘I know what I did was wrong’ there will be no punishment? I was even told many people have had similar issues to mine with this person, yet it was never addressed. I was told they would be spoken to, yet mine, and others’ complaints were blatantly ignored. So I went to a different manager who I know, just to be told that the directors are ‘scared’ of the implications that taking action against this person would cause. So what, this person can be kept in their role, when so many people have complained and had issues, just because there is fear of what might happen if they were removed?<br><br>
								Secondly, EM applications. Now, it’s blatantly obvious they were littered with bias. They were very clearly chosen based on favourites, rather than who was actually best fit for the role. It’s very clear that unless I start ‘simping’, there isn’t any real way forward, so what is the point? Even Charlie <a href="https://youtu.be/hnCm955Du8w?t=913" style="color:lightseagreen">has said it himself</a>, <i>“don’t pick your friends to be on your team. Just because you’re friends with them, doesn’t mean they’ll be suited to be a leader.”</i> I find it quite ironic how he goes against his own advice, hiring someone he knows well, rather than someone who may be better suited to the role. Now, I don’t have anything against this person. They got the role, whether that was fairly and this is all a coincidence, or if the directors had more control over it than they’d like to admit, I don’t know. Doodge later issued a statement about this, however, I find it funny how right after, Charlie issues a statement ultimately refusing to take any of the blame, rejecting all claims, and effectively undoing everything Doodge fixed in his statement.<br><br>
								Next, we have the situation of a certain someone calling an officer who killed a man solely based on the colour of his skin a ‘national hero’. It appals me how management thinks it’s okay to just brush this off like it’s a normal occurrence, only giving them a strike, thinking that’s enough, or just to do something to stop the community from rioting. I cannot begin to comprehend how this can just be accepted, literally making it look like management doesn’t really care about these comments. Bare in mind, this person represents Senior Guards, and for them to not lose their role through management and for this all to be just brushed off is disgusting and quite frankly, horrifying. I could even bet on the fact that if this situation were different, and I were to say what this someone said, I would immediately be fired. It's sad to think that racism is brushed off just because of, presumably, knowing someone well. Thinking it’s okay to call someone a ‘national hero’ for killing someone just because of their race disgusts me, and I am very ashamed that this was ‘tucked under the rug’.<br><br>
								Now we move onto the lack of communication. The channels were locked for about a week, and the community got no information whatsoever. We were not told how long this would last, we did not have any updates, instead, the community was left, their opinions silenced, only building up more pressure and anger. Rather than taking a moment to consider what people were saying, the directors decided to stop them from having a voice. And yes, I agree, spamming and rioting is never a good way to solve a problem, but a lot of the community weren’t doing that, they were just sharing their opinions, trying to help, yet, the opinions of those who fuel your game and your "community" were ignored. Without a community, SCR is nothing but a map and trains.<br><br>
								Let’s move onto yet another point. I want to be fully honest here, I felt forced to resign multiple times. I was asked if I am sure that I am fit for the role, and was told that as a minimum I must do more than the quota. My question is, if the minimum is more than the quota, what is the point of having one in the first place?<br><br>
								Finally, let’s move onto some real life reasons. As you know, Coronavirus has really turned the world upside down. I don’t know if my exams are going ahead, I don’t have a clear vision of the future, and yet I need to worry about a quota, which should not be my main priority. I need to focus on solving what will happen with my future, rather than having to worry about attending 7, well, I guess 8 as the quota is not the minimum apparently, trainings, which is time that I should use revising and preparing for the future.<br><br>
								It’s been a great ride, I’ve made some great friends along the way, but as I said in the beginning, all good things must come to an end. We’ve come full circle.<br><br>
								Thanks for everything,<br>
								Draavo
